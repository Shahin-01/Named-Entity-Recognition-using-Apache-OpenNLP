## Overview

In this project, we have extracted person, location, and organization names from a large document using Java language and [Apache Open NLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) toolkit. The following dependency files should be used:  

• opennlp-tools-1.5.3 – The main executable library file  
• opennlp-maxent-3.0.1- The maximum entropy modeling framework for information integration from ans ample number of sources for classification purposes  
• en-ner-person.bin- A binary file that is used to find people’s names  
• en-ner-location.bin- A binary file that is used to find location names  
• en-ner-organization.bin- A binary file that is used to find organization names  
• en-token.bin – A tokenizer that is trained on the data
